#### Welcome to Chenmingâ€™s Homepage! ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Professor [Yanyongâ€¯Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yanyongz/). Before that, I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from the School of the Gifted Young at USTC in 2021.

I am passionate about real-world sensing and perception, with a particular focus on mmWave radarâ€“based vehicle sensing, including on-board perception for autonomous vehicles and roadside perception for traffic monitoring. My current research interests include millimeter-wave sensing, autonomous driving, smart city, and embodied intelligence.
